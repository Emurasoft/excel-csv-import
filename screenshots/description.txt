CSV Import+Export adds the ability to import and export CSV files to Excel. You can specify several options for importing and exporting: type of input/output (file or textbox), character encoding, delimiter character, and newline sequence. It can import large CSV files, but export size is limited by available memory.

Importing and exporting times are shorter if this add-in is used on the desktop edition of Excel than Online.

Japanese and Chinese translations will be added soon.
